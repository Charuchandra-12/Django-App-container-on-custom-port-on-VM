While recording the video, I encountered an unexpected issue. It so happened that the passcode I entered for my Docker Hub account contained the same number as the key binding in my OBS software responsible for stopping video recording. Consequently, the video abruptly terminated, and OBS did not capture the incident. Following this interruption, I initiated the login process for my Docker Hub account and executed the 'docker-compose up -d' command. Following this, the video captures the relevant pull information displayed on the screen.
